# 50.007-Machine-Learning

This repository consists of solutions to assignments and links to a project from **50.007 - Machine Learning**, a module took in Summer 2024, from the faculty of **Information Systems Technology & Design** (**ISTD**) at the
_**Singapore University of Technology & Design**_ (**SUTD**).

## Homework

In **Homework 1** (**HW1**) there were two questions which require further implementation of machine learning models and they are listed as followed:

1. Question 2: Linear Classification Implementation (10 marks)

   - Perception Algorithm Implementation (Update Rule)
   - Part (a): Perception Algorithm with 1 epoch
   - Part (b): Perception Algorithm with 5 epoch
   - Part (c): Plotting of decision boundary on test data
   - Part (d): Explanation on possibility of achieving 100% accuracy

2. Question 4: Ridge Regression Implementation (10 marks)
   - Part (a): Ridge Regression Implementation
   - Part (b): Plot of validation & training loss as λ varies on a logrithmic scale

## Project

The project in this module is a team proejct and we were encouraged to form teams in any way we like, consisting of either 4 or 5 people. It is being evaluated as a Kaggle competition, and its summary is as followed:

> Online hate speech is an important issue that breaks the cohesiveness of online social communities and even raises public safety concerns in our societies. Motivated by this rising issue, researchers have developed many traditional machine learning and deep learning methods to detect hate speech on online social platforms automatically.
>
> Essentially, the detection of online hate speech can be formulated as a text classification task: "Given a social media post, classify if the post is hateful or non-hateful". In this project, you are to apply machine learning approaches to perform hate speech classification. Specifically, you will need to perform the following tasks.

It has 4 specific tasks to be completed and are listed as:

1. Task 1: Implement Logistic Regression (10 marks)
2. Task 2: Apply Dimension Reduction Techniques (10 marks)
3. Task 3: Try new machine learning models and race to the top! (25 marks)
4. Task 4: Documenting our journey and thoughts (5 marks)

Our team has applied different machine learning models in our ensemble-based model which we have submitted for **Task 3**.
